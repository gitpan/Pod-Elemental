=head1 NAME

Pod::Elemental::Paragraph - a paragraph in a Pod document

=head1 VERSION

version 0.093280

=head1 OVERVIEW

This is probably the most important role in the Pod-Elemental distribution.
Classes including this role represent paragraphs in a Pod document.  The
paragraph is the fundamental unit of dividing up Pod documents, so this is a
often-included role.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 content

This is the textual content of the element, as in a Pod::Eventual event.  In
other words, this Pod:

  =head2 content

has a content of "content\n"

=head2 start_line

This attribute, which may or may not be set, indicates the line in the source
document where the element began.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 as_pod_string

This returns the element  as a string, suitable for turning elements back into
a document.  Some elements, like a C<=over> command, will stringify to include
extra content like a C<=back> command.  In the case of elements with children,
this method will include the stringified children as well.

=head2 as_debug_string

This method returns a string, like C<as_string>, but is meant for getting an
overview of the document structure, and is not suitable for reproducing a
document.  Its exact output is likely to change over time.
