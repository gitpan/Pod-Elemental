Pod::Elemental::Element::Generic::Blank - a series of blank lines

=head1 VERSION

version 0.092941

=head1 OVERVIEW

Generic::Blank elements represent vertical whitespace in a Pod document.  For
the most part, these are meant to be placeholders until made unnecessary by the
Pod5 transformer.  Most end-users will never need to worry about these
elements.
